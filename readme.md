# Text circle validator

A validator for outputs from the [Circle of text characters](https://codegolf.codidact.com/posts/287319) code golf challenge.

## :link: Webpage

[Access the validator directly](https://trichoplax.github.io/text-circle-validator/)

## :wrench: Development

To access the webpage locally for development, you will need an http server as the `.wasm` file will be blocked from loading if the page is opened directly. For example, if you have Python installed, you can enter the following from the `web` directory:

```text
python -m http.server 8080
```

You can then view the page at `localhost:8080` in your browser.
